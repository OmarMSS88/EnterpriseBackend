# EnterpriseBackend
## Introduction
<p>
    For this project, we've crafted a sophisticated microservices backend. Our backend comprises four distinct microservices that collectively shape the fundamental structure of a restaurant: visits, waiters, tables, and dishes. Each of these services has its own dedicated database. All conceivable requests are seamlessly handled by a custom-built gateway.
